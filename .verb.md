This plugin requires the [base-generators][] to be registered first. If not already registered, you can do so now by following [these instructions](#base-generators).

## Usage

```js
var compose = require('{%= name %}');
var Base = require('base');
var app = new Base();

// register the "compose" plugin
app.use(compose());
```

## API

**Heads up!**

Some of the methods exposed on [.compose](#methods) expect for `app` to be an instance of [templates][], or for specific plugins to be registered first. 

You don't need to register all of the plugins prescribed below, just use the plugins you need with the methods you need. `base-compose` will give you detailed error messages when something is missing.

More information is provided in the [methods documentation](#methods) below.
