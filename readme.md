> Selectively merge values from one or more generators onto the current application instance.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install base-compose --save
```

This plugin requires the [base-generators](https://github.com/node-base/base-generators) to be registered first. If not already registered, you can do so now by following [these instructions](#base-generators).

## Usage

```js
var compose = require('base-compose');
var Base = require('base');
var app = new Base();

// register the "compose" plugin
app.use(compose());
```

## API

**Heads up!**

Some of the methods exposed on [.compose](#methods) expect for `app` to be an instance of [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates), or for specific plugins to be registered first.

You don't need to register all of the plugins prescribed below, just use the plugins you need with the methods you need. `base-compose` will give you detailed error messages when something is missing.

More information is provided in the [methods documentation](#methods) below.

### [.compose](index.js#L38)

Setup a composition by passing in an array of generators to compose elements. If a generator cannot be found, an error will be thrown.

**Params**

* `names` **{String|Array}**: One or more generator names.
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns an instance of `Compose`

**Example**

```js
app.compose(['a', 'b', 'c'])
  .data()
  .options()
  .helpers()
  .views();
```

## base-generators

Follow these instructions to install and register the [base-generators](https://github.com/node-base/base-generators) plugin before registering `base-compose`.

**Install base-generators**

```sh
$ npm install base-generators --save
```

**Register base-generators**

```js
var generators = require('base-generators');
var compose = require('base-compose');
var Base = require('base');
var app = new Base();

// register plugins
app.use(generators());
app.use(compose());
```
